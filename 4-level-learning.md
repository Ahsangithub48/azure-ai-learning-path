## 🧬 Level 1: Nanobots

🎯 **Audience:** Ages 10–15  
🧠 **Objective:** Intro to AI & bot building with *zero programming background*  
🛠️ **Format:** 30-minute hands-on lessons (no theory-only)  
📦 **Deliverable:** A functioning mini-bot after each session  

Each lesson results in a simple, fully functional "Nanobot." Example outcomes:

- 🔊 Text-to-Voice Bot  
- 🎙️ Voice-to-Text Bot  
- ⚙️ Logic App bot (e.g., send email when file uploaded)

**Expectations:**

- 10 unique Nanobot sessions  
- 100% no-code, fun-first format  
- Suitable for Vibe Coders & beginner AI enthusiasts

## 🤖 Level 2: Droids

📚 **Builds upon Nanobots.**  
Introduces foundational AI logic and light intelligence.

You’ll learn:

- What GPT is and how it works  
- Create bots that make simple predictions  
- Early intro to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

## 🧠 Level 3: Androids

🧍‍♂️ **Bots with Human-Like Thinking**  
Students begin to integrate AI with psychology and linguistics.

Key topics:

- Prompt Flow and advanced reasoning  
- RAG with vector indexing  
- Inference servers  
- Multi-turn logic and smart conversations

Outcome: You’ll create an intelligent assistant that thinks and talks like a real human.

## 🕸️ Level 4: Swarm of Androids

🕹️ **AI Collaboration at Scale**  
Create a **network of bots** that work together on a shared mission.

Examples:

- AI team solving a problem  
- Bots communicating in real-time  
- Complex orchestration and decision making

This is the **pinnacle** of AI education in this system — a true showcase of teamwork, systems thinking, and coordination.
